When exams are near but you start a new web series
When group project feels like solo project
When WiFi disconnects during an online exam
That moment when your code runs without errors
When teacher says "This is easy"
When you submit assignment at last minute
When laptop updates during online test
When pizza arrives while you diet
When exam starts and you forget everything
When you pass without studying
When you accidentally reply-all in email
When your phone dies at 1% battery
When someone eats your food from fridge
When Monday hits you like a truck
When Netflix asks "Are you still watching?"
When autocorrect changes your message to nonsense
When you find money in your old jacket
When your internet lags during a Zoom call
When you binge-watch and forget to sleep
When the group chat explodes with notifications
When coffee kicks in and productivity rises
When the meeting could've been an email
When your favorite show gets canceled
When the snack is gone before you notice
When you remember homework was due today
When your pet does something hilarious
When your sibling breaks your stuff
When you finally solve a hard coding bug
When your code works on first try
When the power goes out during gaming
When you wake up and forget what day it is
When autocorrect ruins your message
When you get a like from your crush
When the teacher says "Open your books"
When the internet goes down in the middle of a movie
When your delivery is delayed by 1 hour
When you realize you left your wallet at home
When your favorite meme is gone from the page
When you accidentally send a screenshot to the wrong person
When you try to cook and burn everything
When you lose your keys again
When someone spoils your favorite show
When you forget your headphones at home
When your code finally passes all tests
When your team wins after hard work
When you overthink a text you sent
When autocorrect saves you from embarrassment
When someone asks you to explain memes
When you find a new series you love
When Monday feels never-ending
When your snacks mysteriously disappear
When your dog steals your bed
When online class ends early
When your playlist shuffles perfectly
When you trip in public but pretend nothing happened
When your favorite food is on sale
When you get home and remember something important
When someone eats the last slice of pizza
When you realize the weekend is over
When your joke actually makes someone laugh
When your WiFi is faster than ever
When you finally figure out a math problem
When your favorite song comes on shuffle
